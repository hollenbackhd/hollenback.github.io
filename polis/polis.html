                We all know the saying, "All roads lead to Rome", but can the same be said
                for Greek poleis and their civil wars known as staseis? The maps above display the Mediterranean and
                Aegean maps overlaid with known
                <a href="https://projectmercury.eu/datasets/#orbis">ancient Roman Routes.</a>
                Colored dots represent poleis that have experienced staseis, gray dots represent poleis that have not
                gone through civil unrest. The bar graph on the left represents the average number of routes passing
                through the poleis area per staseis. From both the maps and the bar graph we can see a pattern. The
                number of staseis for per poleis appears to increase in regards to the number of routes that go
                through/near the polis. But what could this possibly mean? Perhaps it means that staseis is directly
                related to the flow of information about the possible political climate through shipping routes and
                roads.

                The data presented to you in the histogram may not be the most accurate and would be best considered a
                rough estimate. There are 1870 poleis with roughly 140 of those having any staseis. This hypothesis
                required manually going through the polis and counting the number of routes that went through the same
                area. Human error should be noted when examining the data presented before you.</h5>
