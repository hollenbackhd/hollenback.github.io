                    <h style="color:#930000">Family Ties of the Gods:</h>

                </h5>
                <h5 style="font-size: 15px">These tangled trees represent the most well-known and influential families of Greek and Norse
                    mythology.<br>
                    The first notable difference between the two families is the "tight-knit" relationship the Greek
                    Gods share. <br>The deceitful and violent relationships that Zeus has with his female family members
                    represent the King of God's ultimate power and influence in the family.<br>
                    The relationships between the Norse Gods are less incestuous, although it does occur between
                    Angrboða and her Nephew Loki as well Njörd
                    and his sister siring Freyr and Freya.<br> These relationships are minimal and are not as widespread as
                    Zeus' influence among his family.<br>
                    This difference in relationships may be due to the fact that the Greek Gods and immortal, while the
                    Norse Gods are not. <br>Therefore, the Greek gods are less like the humans that worship them, and the
                    morals and laws that the mortal humans abide by do not affect or influence them in the way that they
                    influence the Norse Gods who have a more direct relationship with their human followers.<br>

                <h5 style="font-size: 15px"><div>
                    Another notable aspect of these family trees is the Patriarchs. For the Greek Gods, there is one
                    creator, Gaia who created her husband Ouranos and together created the pantheon of gods.<br>
                    The Norse Patriarchs are Ymir and Auðumbla. These two Gods essentially create two distinct families
                    that grow and interact with each other later in the tree.<br><br><br><br><br>
